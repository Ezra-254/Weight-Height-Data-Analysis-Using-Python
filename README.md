# Weight-Height-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This study examines the relationship between height and weight in order to determine whether height is a reliable indicator of weight. To comprehend the patterns in the dataset, we conduct statistical analyses and visualizations using Python-based data analysis tools.

# Objectives: 
Using statistical and visual analysis methods, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between height and weight. In particular, the goals consist of:

1.Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Load the dataset and check it for completeness.
- Deal with outliers, duplicates, and missing values.

2.Analysis of Exploratory Data (EDA)
- Determine the mean, median, and standard deviation of descriptive statistics.
- Use box plots and histograms to visualize data distributions.

3.Analysis of Correlation and Relationships
- Examine the relationship between height and weight.
- To see trends, use regression lines and scatter plots.

4.Important Takeaways & Conclusion
- Highlight important observations and provide a summary of the results.
- Talk about any trends, patterns, or ramifications that the data may have.

# Overview of the Report: 
## Introduction
In order to determine whether height is a reliable indicator of weight, this study examines the relationship between height and weight. To comprehend the patterns in the dataset, we conduct statistical analyses and visualizations using Python-based data analysis tools.

## Overview of Data
- The dataset is made up of numerical records of people's weights (pounds) and heights (inches). Prior to analysis, the data is checked for outliers, missing values, and inconsistencies.

## Analysis of Exploratory Data (EDA)
- Histograms and box plots are used to analyze the dataset's distribution in order to comprehend its spread and spot any possible irregularities.
- Simple statistical measures provide information about variability and central tendencies.

## Analysis of Correlation
- To evaluate the relationship between height and weight, the Pearson correlation coefficient is computed.
-The correlation trend is shown using a scatter plot with a regression line.
