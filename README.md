# Weight-Height-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This study examines the relationship between height and weight in order to determine whether height is a reliable indicator of weight. To comprehend the patterns in the dataset, we conduct statistical analyses and visualizations using Python-based data analysis tools.

# Objectives: 
Using statistical and visual analysis methods, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between height and weight. In particular, the goals consist of:

1.Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
-Load the dataset and check it for completeness.
-Deal with outliers, duplicates, and missing values.

2.Analysis of Exploratory Data (EDA)
-Determine the mean, median, and standard deviation of descriptive statistics.
-Use box plots and histograms to visualize data distributions.

3.Analysis of Correlation and Relationships
-Examine the relationship between height and weight.
-To see trends, use regression lines and scatter plots.

4.Important Takeaways & Conclusion
-Highlight important observations and provide a summary of the results.
-Talk about any trends, patterns, or ramifications that the data may have.
